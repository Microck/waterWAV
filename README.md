After getting the video "an interesting way to watermark audio" by idiotinium in my recommended feed a few months ago, I decided to work on an easy way to hide watermarks in audio, accesible to everyone and anyone. Taking a concept that might seem complex or niche and developing a tool that simplifies it empowers many more people to experiment and utilize the technique, whether for artistic expression, a bit of fun, or practical identification.
